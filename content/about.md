Browser compatibility
<p>The code is tested on the newest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Chrome mobile and Firefox mobile in april 2021. This code uses fairly new techniques, like scroll snapping. However, I expect this solution to degrade quite graceful. It even looks and works 'okay-ish' without javascript.</p>

<h2>About the author</h2>
<p>I am a <a href="https://www.usecue.com/">website performance expert</a> and for <a href="https://www.usecue.com/portfolio/poet-vermaat/">a project</a> I was looking for a <a href="https://www.usecue.com/blog/carousel-with-scroll-snap/">touch enabled carousel</a>. I could not find one that was minimal, so I created a basic responsive and touch-enabled carousel that weighs only 3kb (uncompressed and including CSS). This carousel is based on modern web technology and will not slow down (the rendering of) your page... and yes, that <a href="https://petervermaat.nl/">project link</a> is a link to a production website.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The approach is (partly) based on the 2019 scroll snap carousel from <a href="https://nolanlawson.com">Nolan Lawson</a>. The debounce function is written by <a href="https://gomakethings.com">Chris Ferdinandi</a>. The cat images are borrowed from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>.</p>

<h2>License</h2>
<p>WTFPL - This is a GPL-compatible permissive license most commonly used as a free software license. As a public domain like license, the WTFPL is essentially the same as dedication to the public domain. It allows redistribution and modification of the work under any terms. The title is an abbreviation of "Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License".</p>
